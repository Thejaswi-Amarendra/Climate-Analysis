# Climate-Analysis
Project for the course Data Analytics - UE20CS312

## Introduction

Exploratory data analysis on South Indian weather data obtained from the NASA POWER project and forecast of temperature in Chennai. Temperature forecast was carried out using LSTM and GRU models.

## Model performance

Model MAPE(%) |RMSE
LSTM for single-step forecast |0.32 |0.13
LSTM for single-step forecast using multi-variate data |2.36 |0.13
LSTM for multi-step forecast using multi-variate data |2.46 |0.84
