# Data
We obtained the datasets for this project from https://power.larc.nasa.gov/.

The POWER project by NASA targets three user communities. Agroclimatology, Renewable energy and Sustainable buildings. The parameters vary based on the targeted user communities. We chose the Renewable energy community.
We had options for hourly, daily, monthly, yearly and climatology weather/climate data. We chose daily data. 

The data was taken from 1/1/1981 to 31/8/2022 in csv formats.

Since this project focuses mainly on South Indian climate, we went with cities like Bangalore, Chennai, Thiruvananthapuram etc.

**The parameters that suited our project the best according to us were, **

|Sl.No|Parameter|Abbreviation|Definition|
| ------------- | ------------- | ----- | ----- |
|1|Temperature at 2 Meters|T2M|The average air (dry bulb) temperature at 2 meters above the surface of the earth.|
|2|Temperature at 2 Meters Maximum|T2M_MAX|The maximum hourly air (dry bulb) temperature at 2 meters above the surface of the earth in the period of interest.|
|3|Dew/Frost Point at 2 Meters|T2MDEW|The dew/frost point temperature at 2 meters above the surface of the earth.|
|4|Wet Bulb Temperature at 2 Meters|T2MWET|The adiabatic saturation temperature which can be measured by a thermometer covered in a water-soaked cloth over which air is passed at 2 meters above the surface of the earth.|
|5|Earth Skin Temperature|TS|The average temperature at the earth's surface.|
|6|Specific Humidity at 2 Meters|QV2M|The ratio of the mass of water vapor to the total mass of air at 2 meters (g water/kg total air).|
|7|Relative Humidity at 2 Meters|RH2M|The ratio of actual partial pressure of water vapor to the partial pressure at saturation, expressed in percent.|
|8|Precipitation Corrected|PRECTOTCORR|The bias corrected average of total precipitation at the surface of the earth in water mass (includes water content in snow).|
|9|Surface Pressure|PS|The average of surface pressure at the surface of the earth.|
|10|Wind Speed at 10 Meters|WS10M|The average of wind speed at 10 meters above the surface of the earth.|
|11|Wind Direction at 10 Meters|WD10M|The average of the wind direction at 10 meters above the surface of the earth.|
|12|Wind Speed at 50 Meters|WS50M|The average of wind speed at 50 meters above the surface of the earth.|
|13|Wind Direction at 50 Meters|WD50M|The average of the wind direction at 50 meters above the surface of the earth.|
|14|All Sky Surface UV Index|ALLSKY_SFC_UV_INDEX|The ultraviolet radiation exposure index.|
|15|All Sky Surface UVA Irradiance|ALLSKY_SFC_UVA|The ultraviolet A (UVA 315nm-400nm) irradiance under all sky conditions.|
|16|All Sky Surface UVB Irradiance|ALLSKY_SFC_UVB|The ultraviolet B (UVB 280nm-315nm) irradiance under all sky conditions.|
|17|Surface Soil Wetness|GWETTOP|The percent of soil moisture a value of 0 indicates a completely water-free soil and a value of 1 indicates a completely saturated soil; where surface is the layer from the surface 0 cm to 5 cm below grade.|
|18|Root Zone Soil Wetness|GWETROOT|The percent of root zone soil wetness a value of 0 indicates a completely water-free soil and a value of 1 indicates a completely saturated soil; where root zone is the layer from the surface 0 cm to 100 cm below grade.|
|19|Profile Soil Moisture|GWETPROF|The percent of profile soil moisture a value of 0 indicates a completely water-free soil and a value of 1 indicates a completely saturated soil; where profile is the layer from the surface down to the bedrock.|
