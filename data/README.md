# Data
We obtained the datasets for this project from https://power.larc.nasa.gov/.

The POWER project by NASA targets three user communities. Agroclimatology, Renewable energy and Sustainable buildings. The parameters vary based on the targeted user communities. We chose the Renewable energy community.
We had options for hourly, daily, monthly, yearly and climatology weather/climate data. We chose daily data. 

The data was taken from 1/1/1981 to 31/8/2022 in csv formats.

Since this project focuses mainly on South Indian climate, we went with cities like Bangalore, Chennai, Thiruvananthapuram etc.

The parameters that suited our project the best according to us were, 

| Sl.No | Parameter | Abbreviation | Definition |
|1|Temperature at 2 Meters|T2M|The average air (dry bulb) temperature at 2 meters above the surface of the earth.|
|2|Temperature at 2 Meters Maximum|T2M_MAX|The maximum hourly air (dry bulb) temperature at 2 meters above the surface of the earth in the period of interest.|
|3|Dew/Frost Point at 2 Meters|T2MDEW|The dew/frost point temperature at 2 meters above the surface of the earth.|
|4|Wet Bulb Temperature at 2 Meters|T2MWET|The adiabatic saturation temperature which can be measured by a thermometer covered in a water-soaked cloth over which air is passed at 2 meters above the surface of the earth.|
|5|Earth Skin Temperature|TS|The average temperature at the earth's surface.|
|6|Specific Humidity at 2 Meters|QV2M|The ratio of the mass of water vapor to the total mass of air at 2 meters (g water/kg total air).|
|7|Relative Humidity at 2 Meters|RH2M|The ratio of actual partial pressure of water vapor to the partial pressure at saturation, expressed in percent.|
|8|Precipitation Corrected|PRECTOTCORR|The bias corrected average of total precipitation at the surface of the earth in water mass (includes water content in snow).|
|9|Surface Pressure|PS|The average of surface pressure at the surface of the earth.|
